# Direct Network Access

The expands on the basic example, adding direct network access to the server, a public elastic IP, and a domain as well.

The goal of this example is to show how you could enable access directly to an application running on the server.
No application is deployed in this example,
 but if the AMI happened to already have an application deployed you could enable it with this example.
