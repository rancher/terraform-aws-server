# Private Project

In this example we use the access and server modules to start a project that is inaccessible from public IP addresses.

## Why?

At first this may seem like a pointless use case because there is no way for anyone to access anything that the servers host.

That is a valid critique, but this module is designed to allow the user to expose their services securely and how they are comfortable.
This example shows that servers can be provisioned completely locked down without external access available.
From here a user could write their own configuration to expose the server.
